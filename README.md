# Subscription-Cancelation-Analysis
Analysis of user subscription cancellations to find out why users are canceling and find opportunities to lower churn.

# Executive Summary:
Facing significant churn and resulting revenue loss, the company's leadership seeks deeper insights into the drivers of subscription cancellations to inform future retention efforts. 
This analysis uses user-reported cancellation reasons to identify trends and provide recommendations to support future retention efforts.

# Business Problem:
Company leadership has noticed significant churn this year, which has had a significant negative impact on revenue, so they're planning a company-wide retention effort. However, we don't currently have any insights or reporting on churn, so the analytics team has decided to analyze user-reported data from the product's cancellation workflow to identify trends in why users are cancelling.
